        <p><b>Perspective Sidewalk</b></p>
        <p> For this project, we had to create 
          a piece using perspective. Essentially, 
          we had to repeat some visual element at 
          smaller and smaller intervals to create 
          a believable sense of depth. I created 
          this process by adding a sidewalk with each
           part getting smaller as it gets farther 
           away. You can also see this in the grass.
            The blades get smaller and less detailed
             the farther away.</p>

           I picked The PowerPuff Girls because the intro is literally instructions. 
           The manuals usually had a character explaining the instructions, so I just
            put the professor since he created the girls. I used vector in photoshop 
            to create everything for this project. </p>

          in a social situation, and we had to create currency for said animal.
           I picked peacocks, because I think if they were like humans, they
            would be egotistical and think they deserve to rule. I didn’t really
             have a goal with this one, but I’m really happy with how it turned 
             out! I had to use a bunch of overlays and the hue and saturation
              adjustment, which was difficult to get correct.</p>

          type of symmetry where similar parts are arranged in a circular 
          fashion around a central axis. I achieved this by arranging puppies
          in a circular fashion around a piece of bacon, like they're worshipping
          their favorite treat.

          identical girls with cat heads. I wanted them to have same vibes as the 
          creepy twins from The Shining. They also have cats on their dresses, 
          which I think is really cute.

          to create this fun collage thing.

        <p> For this project, we had to create a color idiom in Photoshop
           and make it literal. An idiom is an expression that shouldn’t 
           be taken literally, like how mine is “feeling blue” which usually
            means feeling sad. I did Blue Diamond from Steven Universe, who
            is a blue entity that can force her feelings onto others. 
            I thought this was perfect, since Blue is blue and she’s 
            lways sad. I had to use vector, hue and saturation 
            adjustments, and shading for this project.</p>

        already taken this class, I could just do whatever colors I wanted.
        I did use complimentary colors for the background and eyes though, along 
        with the many other colors that go well with this art. I drew everything 
        colored pencil.

      <p>This is also another piece I did entirely with colored pencil. This was one of
        those projects where I could do whatever I wanted. The emotion evolved over time and
        it looked like they were worried about something, so I added sweat drops. The bright
        red hair, yellow background, and blue drops are meant to make this piece based
        on primary colors.

        because I think they're beautiful. For example, I added a bumpy nose, small lips, a 
        tooth gap, downturned eyes, bushy eyebrows, and eye bags. I thought she looked a little
        sad about something, so that's where she got her name from.

      dad and I love to look at up at the stars. I added a music note in the middle,
